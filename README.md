## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 This Repository
All of the materials for the module this semester will appear in this
repository. You can also access them via the links on Blackboard, but the
advantage of storing the actual files here is that you can clone this repository
onto your own machine and on Codio. 

To do that, you need to issue the following command in a terminal window:

```console
git clone https://github.com/UoS-COM1001/com1001-2025-26-spr.git
```

### 2.2 Your Codio Setup

You need to get Codio setup so that you can develop your team project and run
the code examples in this repository. To do this, follow the instructions on
the [Setting Up Codio](./setting-up-codio.md) page.

### 2.3 If You Encounter Technical Problems and What To Do About Them

If you encounter technical problems or issues, check out the [Technical
FAQ](technical-faq.md). 

You can also ask one of the teaching staff in or after a lecture, or in a
practical class, or use the Discussion Forum on Blackboard. (Try to make sure
your question isn't already addressed in the FAQ though &mdash; or, if it is,
you've given following the instructions in the answer a go.) Either way, we're a
very friendly teaching team, and we're happy to take your questions, so don't be
afraid to ask or talk to us!

The [Team Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnPWhO-lEBKgKVnu1H7qYSPGQHJFqtnQITdZI5M6Rgg/edit?usp=sharing) will give necessary details
about your team project and assessments. If you have any questions regarding
that, please consult the [Project FAQ](project-faq.md) and use the Discussion
Board/Forum.

## 3. Schedule and Resources

Materials for the module can all be found in this repository, which consists of
directories corresponding to content for each week. Files will be added as we
proceed through the module.

If you've cloned this repository, you can just do a `git pull` each week to get
the new materials. 

Lecture and practical content for this module is front-loaded in weeks 1&ndash;5
so that you have all the knowledge and expertise that you need to complete
development and testing of the team project in the remainder of the semester.

### Lectures

Lectures will be held on *Tuesdays 11am&ndash;1pm* in **St George's Church** and
Wednesdays 12&ndash;1pm in the
**[Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/floor-plans),
Lecture Theatre 3** in weeks 1&ndash;5. 

There will be a break during 2 hour lectures, and also a (non-assessed) team
quiz. There will be a prize in week 5 for the team that performs best overall in
the quizzes.

### Practical Sessions

Practical sessions will be held on *Thursdays 3&ndash;4pm*.

Where exactly and what we will do depends on the week:

#### Weeks 1&ndash;5
In weeks 1&ndash;5, the practical sessions consist of **code jams**. You will
sit with your teammates and work through applying that week's lecture material
to your team project. 

If you've got as far as you can, there will also be further coding exercises to
help you sharpen your skills. 

You will need to bring your own laptop to this session, or use the laptop loan facility.

<!--
Where you go and where you sit depends on which team you're in:
* **Teams 1&ndash;23** need to go to **Computer Room 3** on the second floor, and follow the [seating plan for CR3](misc/cr3-practicals.pdf).
* **Teams 24&ndash;47** need to go to **Computer Room 5** on the ground floor, and follow the [seating plan for CR5](misc/cr5-practicals.pdf).

 [Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/floor-plans)**.
-->

#### Weeks 6&ndash;11

In weeks 6&ndash;11, the practical session will take the form of an (optional, 
drop-in) technical help session. 

It will be held in the
**[Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/floor-plans),
Computer Room 3**.

Here, you can talk to us about any technical problems you're experiencing with
your code, or ask any other question you like (e.g., re-explaining lecture
content) and we'll endeavour to help. The whole room will be reserved so you can
use the space to work simultaneously in your teams.

<!--
### Scrum Meetings

Each team will have timetabled scrum meetings once a week, **starting in week 1 and finishing in week 11**. These meetings will happen on **Tuesday afternoons between 2-3pm in Computer Room 3 (second floor) or Computer Room 5 (ground floor)** of the Diamond. Check out the [seating plan](misc/cr3-cr5-scrum-meetings.pdf) to find out where you need to be.

Each team will be allocated a supervisor (a member of the department's teaching staff). Your team supervisor will check-in with you to see how your project is going during the scrum meetings. See the [Team Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnPWhO-lEBKgKVnu1H7qYSPGQHJFqtnQITdZI5M6Rgg/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

Note: your team supervisor will focus on monitoring your progress and teamwork, *not* providing technical advice on your project. Technical advice will be available (via the demonstrators) in the scheduled practical sessions listed above.
